I did this bubble sort in maybe 15 minutes when my work placement boss brought in an old BBC Microcomputer!

It's stored in a .BBC file that I used within [BBCWIN](https://www.bbcbasic.co.uk/bbcsdl/index.html) but also in a text file so you can copy and paste it into your own BBC Microcomputer emulator or use it in a BBC Microcomputer.

Feel free to use it, modify it, and share it as you wish. If you do make any changes, please consider sharing them back with the community. Pass it off as your own for all I care, I just found the lack of doccumentation on BBC Microcomputer code a bit sad and wanted to help out. Might create other basic algorithms in the future. :3

Just felt like being a little silly on an old computer XD
